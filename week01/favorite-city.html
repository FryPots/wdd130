    <h1>THE VATICAN</h1>
    <p>Vatican City,[b][c] officially the Vatican City State (Italian: Stato della Città del
        Vaticano;[d]
        Latin: Status Civitatis Vaticanae),[e][f] often shortened as the Vatican, is a landlocked
        sovereign
        city-state. Ruled by the pope, it is an enclave within Rome and serves as the administrative
        centre
        of the Catholic Church.[14][15] Vatican City is governed by the See of Rome, commonly known
        as the
        Holy See, itself a sovereign entity under international law, which maintains its temporal
        power,
        governance, diplomacy, and spiritual independence. Vatican is also used as a metonym for the
        Holy
        See, which is the central governing body of the Catholic Church and Vatican City, comprising
        the
        pope and the Roman Curia.[16] The independent state of Vatican City came into existence in
        1929 via
        the Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and the Kingdom of Italy, which spoke of it as a new
        creation,[17] not as a vestige of the much larger Papal States (756–1870), which had
        previously
        encompassed much of Central Italy.

        With an area of 48.99 hectares (121 acres)[g] and a population of about 882[11] in 2024, it
        is the
        smallest sovereign state in the world both by area and by population. It is the only country
        in the
        world with a population of under 1,000 people.[18] It is among the least populated capitals
        in the
        world. As governed by the Holy See, Vatican City State is an ecclesiastical or
        sacerdotal-monarchical state ruled by the pope, who is the bishop of Rome and head of the
        Catholic
        Church; the highest state functionaries are all Catholic clergy of various origins.[19][20]
        The Holy
        See dates to early Christianity and is the principal episcopal see of the Catholic Church,
        which in
        2018 had about 1.329 billion baptized Catholics in the world, in the Latin Church and 23
        Eastern
        Catholic Churches.[21] After the Avignon Papacy (1309–1377) the popes have mainly resided at
        the
        Apostolic Palace within what is now Vatican City, although at times residing instead in the
        Quirinal
        Palace in Rome or elsewhere.</p>
